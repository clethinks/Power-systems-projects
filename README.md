**1. Transformer protection**

Investigating differential relay characteristics (ANSI 87) and sizing current transformers for transformer differential protection


**2. Relay code**

code written in processing to show the Relay ANSI numbers for protection in a power system


**3. Motor analysis**

motor starting methods compared, DOL and star delta (Y-D). Modelled the two starting methods on Etap software and exported motor currents as .xlsx and imported to MATLAB for data visualization and analysis.

*analysis*

DOL has a much higher peak current, causing more stress on electrical systems.
Star-Delta takes longer to reach steady-state, but it significantly reduces inrush current.
Energy consumption is lower in Star-Delta, making it more efficient for startup.
The rate of change of current is much higher in DOL, which can cause voltage dips in the power system.
